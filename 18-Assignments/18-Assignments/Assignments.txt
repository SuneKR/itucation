------ Exercise 1 ------

--------- Exercise 2 ---------
The Car class has to implement the IAutomobile interface. Modify the code to make sure this happens.
You can assume that the interface stays empty.
Run your code to check your output (expected output: True)

public interface IAutomobile
{
    // Empty Interface
}

public class Car 
{
    public string brand;
    public Car()
    {
        brand = "Ferrari";
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Car ferrari = new Car();
    Console.WriteLine((typeof(IAutomobile).IsAssignableFrom(ferrari.GetType())));
} 

- - - Answer - - -

public class Car : Automobile


--------- Exercise 3 ---------
delegate void Del(string s);
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    void Notify(string s)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"I hereby notify you: {s}");
    }
    // Code would go here
}

What is the correct way(s) to instantiate the delegate:
 1. Del d1 = Notify;
 2. Del d1 = new Notify;
 3. Del d1 = new Del(Notify);
 4. Del d1 = new Del(Notify("Hej"));
